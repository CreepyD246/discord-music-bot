# discord-music-bot

This is a simple discord music bot that streams music instead of downloading a stand-alone music file. This bot was made to support the tutorial video that was made alongside it.   

You can watch that tutorial here - https://youtu.be/xyVY4n4_0MQ

## Requirements
You'll need to install the following modules/libraries:  
```pip install youtube_dl```  
```pip install discord```  

You'll also need to create a Bot Application on Discord's Developer Portal - https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro  

You'll also need to download and set up ffmpeg, but you can see the whole process of doing that in the tutorial video - https://youtu.be/xyVY4n4_0MQ

## Features
- The bot can only play 1 song at a time and can't queue songs.
- The bot can pause, resume, and stop music
- The bot uses youtube_dl to stream the music, but doesn't download the music file onto the computer
